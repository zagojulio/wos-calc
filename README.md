## üß± Architecture

- Modular layout with separation of concerns:
  - `features/`: core features (purchase_manager, pack_value_comparison, hall_of_chiefs, speedup_inventory)
  - `utils/`, `config/`, `styles/`: helper modules and UI config
  - `calculations.py`: computational logic
  - `visualizations.py`: plotting and chart functions
  - `app.py`: main Streamlit app with three-tab navigation
- Uses Plotly for interactive charts
- Session-based state for dynamic data flow
- Dark-themed UI with custom CSS
- CSV and JSON-based data persistence
- Type hints and docstrings throughout

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

- Git workflow with main, dev, and feature branches
- Commit convention: `[TYPE]: description` (e.g., `FEAT: Add pack purchase tracker`)
- Comprehensive test suite with 72% coverage (target: 80%)
- Modular architecture for maintainability

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Current test coverage: 72% (needs improvement to reach 80% target)

## üìÅ Data Files

- `data/purchase_history.csv`: Automatic purchase history
- `data/manual_purchases.csv`: Manual purchase entries
- `data/pack_value_comparison.json`: Pack comparison data
- `data/hall_of_chiefs_data.json`: Hall of Chiefs entries
- `data/speedup_inventory.json`: Speed-up inventory data
- `data/pack_items.json`: Pack contents data (not currently integrated)
